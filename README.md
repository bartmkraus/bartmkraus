# Hello there! ğŸ‘‹
My name is BartÅ‚omiej, but actually you can just call me Bart. I'm just an average fan of the Python programming language.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker, Terraform and Go.

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on a home budget app to practice some elements of DevOps.

ğŸŒŸ I am an active member of Hackerspace TrÃ³jmiasto.
